"A classical Baroque painting depicting a dramatic mythological or historical scene, likely from ancient Roman or Greek lore, characterized by dynamic figures, rich colors, and a blend of earthly and divine elements. The central figure is a standing warrior in elaborate bronze/gold armor with a red cloak, who has just defeated another warrior lying on the ground. Above are several divine or allegorical figures on clouds, and the background transitions from a cloudy celestial realm to an architectural setting."
